# Stock Manager

a simple cli stock manager written in c++ that uses a high-performance Swiss-Table-style hash table that uses AVX2 to manage stock data.

## Design Features:

- open adressing with metadata byte
- tomnstone reuse
- (optional) AVX2 vector search ( compare 32 bytes simultaniously )
- plot historical price data ( ASCI Plot )

## Build dependencies:

```bash
g++ ( with c++17 support )
make
```

## Build and Run

```bash
# clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/floegger/stock_manager.git

# build: make [options]
make                # build with default options

# options:
clean          # remove build files
release        # build with optimizations and no debug info
test           # run tests
avx2           # build with avx2 optimizations*
avx2-release   # build with avx2 optimizations and no debug info

# get help:
make help

# run:
cd build # binaries  are located in the build/ folder
./stock_manager
```

    *avx2 requires a cpu and compiler support. If you get an error about avx2 not being supported, try building without it.

## Menu options:

```

0    STATS      show hash table stats and 'mini' benchmarks ( 200 runs )
1    ADD        add a new stock ( name, symbol, wkn )
2    DELETE     delete a stock by name or symbol
3    IMPORT     import historical prices for a given stock
4    SEARCH     search for a stock by name or symbol
5    PLOT       plot the last 30 days of historical prices for a given stock
6    LIST       list all stocks in the database
7    SAVE       save the database to a file
8    LOAD       load the database from a file
9    QUIT
B    BATCH      batch import stock prices from a folder
```

Enter number or string ( 0-9 or command name ):
